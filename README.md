# Take a break

Take a break is a chrome extension that monitors and reminds you to take breaks periodically.

## Features

Take a break focuses on three important aspects during screen time. Look away from screen, stay hydrated and stretch your body. A default or recommended intervals are preset for different types of breaks that can be adjusted as per your requirements.

When it is time to take a break, the extension nudges an overlay on the active tab reminding you to take a break.
This overlay can be dismissed before it is automatically removed after the break duration.

Addtionally, you can enable push notifications that broadcasts a notification at every break interval. This is especially useful when you perform tasks across browser and other applications.
